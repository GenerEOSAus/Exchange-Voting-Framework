I vote for BPs who understand this and who provide value to the EOS ecosystem through innovation, education, and helping build the tools the world needs to advance forward and improve. I believe all human interactions should be voluntary and monopolies on violence and currency creation within geographic regions will become archaic relics of our past. Our circle of empathy is expanding towards cooperation and abundance. Technologies like EOS empower us all to function as efficient peer networks instead of dominating hierarchies. Non-violent communication, education, and blockchain consensus can help the right BPs secure and protect this collaborative commons. Entrepreneurship, specialization, economic freedom, and mutually beneficial exchange of value will increase prosperity for us all if EOS is run by the right block producers.","background":"I built my first websites in 1996, got a degree in computer science at UPENN in 2001, and eventually co-founded FoxyCart.com which I sold to my business partner in 2018 after ten successful years to focus full-time on projects in the cryptocurrency space. My first bitcoin purchase was in January of 2013 where I paid $50 to get 2.5 BTC. I have been a Steem Witness (block producer) since May of 2017 and joined the launch team of eosDAC in April of 2018. I like to be involved in and learn from many different cryptocurrency projects like BitShares and SmartCash.

This means no self-appointed, unelected authoritarian bodies should ever exist on EOS and bear any power over the community. We believe in free market as the only force able to regulate EOS long term.
